# nixconfig

My NixOS configuration as a flake.

The configuration is in very early state and is not recommended for public
usage: it is mostly a personal backup right now.

It is public because it's more convenient for me. Don't depend on this
repository (in your own flakes, for example). Right now I don't even know
whether I will use NixOS regularly and develop this configuration to
somewhat working public state or just delete the repository. Bad practice,
I know.
